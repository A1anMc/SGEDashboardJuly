- **Location**: `app/services/scrapers/base_scraper.py` lines 80-88

#### 3. Duplicate Detection (Hashing/Fingerprinting)
- **Implementation**: Database-based duplicate detection
- **Method**: Uses combination of `source` + `application_url` as unique identifier
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of existing grants
  - Update existing grants vs. create new ones
  - Prevents data redundancy
- **Location**: `app/services/scrapers/base_scraper.py` lines 67-85

#### 4. Scheduled Jobs
- **Implementation**: Daily automated scraping using fastapi-utils
- **Features**:
  - Runs once per day at startup
  - Concurrent scraping from multiple sources
  - Automatic retry and error handling
  - Comprehensive logging of results
- **Location**: `SGE_Dashboard_Scaffold/backend/main.py` lines 51-83

#### 5. Notification System
- **Implementation**: Email notification system (task-focused, not scraper-specific)
- **Features**:
  - HTML email templates
  - Task assignment and update notifications
  - SendGrid integration
  - Configurable email settings
- **Location**: `app/core/email.py`, `app/templates/email/`

#### 6. Project ‚Üí Grant Matching Logic
- **Implementation**: Advanced matching algorithm with weighted scoring
- **Features**:
  - 100-point scoring system with multiple criteria
  - Industry focus matching (30 points)
  - Location eligibility (20 points)
  - Organization type compatibility (15 points)
  - Funding purpose alignment (15 points)
  - Audience targeting (10 points)
  - Timeline compatibility (10 points)
- **Location**: `app/routers/grants.py` lines 154-175

#### 7. Tag-based Filtering
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive hierarchical tag system
- **Features**:
  - Parent-child tag relationships
  - Synonym support for better matching
  - Project and grant tag associations
  - CRUD operations for tag management
- **Location**: `app/models/tag.py`, `app/routers/tags.py`

#### 8. API Access Control
- **Implementation**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Features**:
  - Token-based authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - OAuth2 password bearer scheme
  - Session management
- **Location**: `app/core/security.py`, `app/core/deps.py`

### ‚ùå Missing Features

#### 1. Rate Limiting/Throttling Protection
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Impact**: Risk of being blocked by external APIs
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting using libraries like `slowapi` or custom throttling logic

#### 2. Grant Export Functionality
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Missing Features**:
  - CSV export
  - Airtable integration
  - Notion integration
  - PDF reports
- **Recommendation**: Add export endpoints and integrate with external services

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Scraper Architecture
- **Base Class**: `BaseScraper` provides common functionality
- **Concrete Scrapers**: `BusinessGovScraper` and `GrantConnectScraper`
- **Data Normalization**: Consistent data format across sources
- **Database Integration**: SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence

#### Current Scraper Sources
1. **business.gov.au**: Government grant database
2. **grantconnect.gov.au**: Federal grant opportunities

#### Data Flow
1. Scheduled job triggers scraper execution
2. Each scraper fetches data from external APIs/websites
3. Data is normalized using base scraper methods
4. Duplicate detection prevents redundant entries
5. New/updated grants are saved to database
6. Comprehensive logging tracks the entire process

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add throttling to prevent API blocking
2. **Add Export Functionality**: CSV and external service integration
3. **Enhance Scraper Logging**: Add dedicated ScraperLog model for better tracking

### Medium Priority
1. **Webhook System**: Add scraper-specific notifications
2. **Advanced Scheduling**: Move from simple daily schedule to configurable cron expressions
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time scraper status and performance metrics

### Low Priority
1. **Additional Sources**: Expand to more grant databases
2. **Machine Learning**: Enhanced matching algorithms
3. **API Rate Monitoring**: Track and optimize API usage patterns

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens are properly validated
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- CORS is configured for production environments

## Performance Notes

- Scrapers run as background tasks to avoid blocking main application
- Database connections are properly managed
- Duplicate detection is optimized using database indexes
- Logging is structured for efficient querying

## Conclusion

The scraping subsystem is well-implemented with most core features present. The main gaps are in rate limiting and export functionality, which should be addressed for production readiness. The existing architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
