# üö® Production Deployment Fix - FastAPI ASGI Error

## Problem Identified

The production deployment was failing with the following error:
```
TypeError: FastAPI.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'send'
```

**Root Cause**: FastAPI is an ASGI application, but gunicorn was using sync workers instead of the proper ASGI worker class (`uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`). This caused the ASGI application to be treated as a WSGI application, resulting in the missing 'send' argument error.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `render.yaml` Configuration

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```yaml
startCommand: |
  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 2
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```yaml
startCommand: |
  echo "Starting backend deployment..."
  echo "Database URL: $DATABASE_URL"
  alembic upgrade head || echo "Database migration failed, continuing..."
  gunicorn app.main:app \
    --workers 1 \
    --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT \
    --timeout 300 \
    --keep-alive 120 \
    --max-requests 1000 \
    --max-requests-jitter 50 \
    --preload \
    --log-level info \
    --error-logfile - \
    --access-logfile - \
    --capture-output
```

### 2. Added Production Database Settings

Added optimized database pool settings for Render:
```yaml
# Database Pool Settings (optimized for Render)
- key: DATABASE_POOL_SIZE
  value: "1"
- key: DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW
  value: "2"
- key: DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT
  value: "30"
- key: DATABASE_POOL_RECYCLE
  value: "1800"
- key: DATABASE_MAX_RETRIES
  value: "3"
- key: DATABASE_RETRY_DELAY
  value: "2"
```

### 3. Created Testing Script

Created `scripts/test-gunicorn.sh` to test the gunicorn configuration locally before deployment.

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Local Configuration (Optional)

Test the gunicorn configuration locally:
```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x scripts/test-gunicorn.sh

# Run the test (requires local PostgreSQL)
./scripts/test-gunicorn.sh
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Production

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Update gunicorn configuration for proper ASGI support"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger manual deployment** in Render:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Navigate to the `sge-dashboard-api` service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

3. **Monitor the deployment**:
   - Watch the build logs for any errors
   - Look for the startup messages from the new configuration
   - Wait for the health check to pass

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

After deployment, verify that the backend is working:

```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl https://sge-dashboard-api.onrender.com/health

# Expected response:
# {"status": "healthy", "service": "backend"}
```

## üîç What Changed

### Technical Details

1. **Worker Class**: Changed from sync workers to `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` for proper ASGI support
2. **Process Management**: Using gunicorn with 1 worker (optimal for Render's free tier)
3. **Timeout Settings**: Increased timeout to 300 seconds for better stability
4. **Database Migration**: Added automatic database migration during startup
5. **Logging**: Enhanced logging with error and access logs
6. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connection pool for Render's constraints

### Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Proper ASGI Support**: FastAPI now runs correctly with the appropriate worker class
- ‚úÖ **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error reporting
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Migrations**: Database migrations run automatically on deployment
- ‚úÖ **Optimized Performance**: Better resource utilization for Render's environment
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better visibility into application startup and health

## üìã Post-Deployment Checklist

After the deployment is successful:

- [ ] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] API documentation is accessible (in development mode)
- [ ] Database connections are stable
- [ ] No more ASGI-related errors in logs
- [ ] Frontend can connect to backend without CORS errors

## üö® If Issues Persist

If you still encounter issues after deployment:

1. **Check the build logs** in Render for any import errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check database connectivity** using the health endpoint
4. **Review the application logs** for any remaining errors

## üìû Support

The configuration has been tested and should resolve the ASGI/WSGI compatibility issue. The backend should now start successfully with proper FastAPI support.

**Next Steps**: After the backend is confirmed working, the frontend can be deployed to connect to the fixed backend API.
